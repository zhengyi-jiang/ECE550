Tell us about your summer!
Did you complete an internship? Let us know about it.  No internship? Tell us what you did.
Maybe your experience was great, or awful! Take 5 minutes now and tell us about it.
The information you provide will help us understand what a Duke student's internship, job, or other experiential learning experience looks like, and how we can better prepare students for these opportunities.  We also want to brag about you to prospective employers and students. You may even be selected to share your experience through a special profile on our website and/or social media!
